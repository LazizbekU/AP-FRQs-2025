## Question 1 Analysis
### Dog Walker

This section contains my analysis of Question 1 (Methods and Control Structures):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- I tryed to read minimun. This didn't work in my favor because I lost lots of time after I got confused.
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- I made the code much simplier, I didn't overthink it and did the minimum to meet all the conditions.
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- The idea of this question is if you can use if statements as the question asks.
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- I learned to never rush the question because it can make you lose lots of time instead of saving time (T-T)
